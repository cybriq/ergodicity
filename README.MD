## About

Ergodicity is an extension of the Tendermint blockchain architecture that
adds a dynamic, session based sharding protocol for real time applications
with a DAG structured transaction log for concurrent transactions.

Ergodicity will be designed to be a drop-in replacement for Tendermint in a
Cosmos SDK application and will add tooling like [Ignite](https://github.com/ignite-hq/cli)
to easily add gRPC/Protobuf based API for realtime applications such as
multiplayer games, virtual worlds and collaborative work environments.

### White Paper

Ergodicity is the core state machine replication core for the Phase project,
which adds the security of token emission control via Proof of Work.

The White Paper is

### Current Status

The work will proceed independently from Tendermint based on the 0.34.13 release
so as to provide a stable basis to work from.
